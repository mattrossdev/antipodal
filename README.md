# Antipodal

This is a web app I made that looks up a location and displays the antipodal location (the complete opposite point on Earth).

You can view a live demo [here](https://main--antipodal.netlify.app/). 

# Setup

To get started, clone this repository and get access to a Google Maps API Key. In the root directory, create a file named apikey.js and add
```
const API_KEY = "your-api-key";
```

## API 

Antipodal is powered by the Google Maps and Google Geocoding APIs. Daily requests may be limited based on usage and cost.
